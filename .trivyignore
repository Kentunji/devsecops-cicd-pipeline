# Trivy Ignore Configuration for OWASP Juice Shop
# =============================================================================
#
# APPLICATION CONTEXT:
# OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally vulnerable web application designed
# for security training, penetration testing practice, and CTF challenges.
# It deliberately uses outdated dependencies to demonstrate real-world
# vulnerability types.
#
# =============================================================================
# REMEDIATION SUMMARY:
# =============================================================================
#
# Total Vulnerabilities Found: 32 CRITICAL/HIGH severity CVEs
# Status: 1 Fixed, 31 Accepted (Documented)
#
# Fixed Vulnerabilities:
# ----------------------
# ✅ CVE-2023-46233 (CRITICAL)
#    Package: crypto-js 3.3.0 → 4.2.0
#    Issue: Weak PBKDF2 implementation (1000x weaker than standard)
#    Resolution: Upgraded to secure version
#    Commit: [Git commit hash]
#
# Accepted Vulnerabilities:
# -------------------------
# ⚠️  31 CRITICAL/HIGH severity CVEs in dependencies
#    Reason: Intentional for security training purposes
#    Risk Level: Acceptable in non-production training environment
#    Mitigation: Application isolated, not exposed to production networks
#
# =============================================================================
# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT POLICY:
# =============================================================================
#
# ❌ This .trivyignore file MUST NOT be used in production deployments
#
# For production, all vulnerabilities must be remediated through:
# 1. Dependency upgrades to latest secure versions
# 2. Code refactoring to handle breaking changes
# 3. Comprehensive regression testing
# 4. Security validation and re-scanning
# 5. Penetration testing before go-live
#
# =============================================================================
# EDUCATIONAL VALUE:
# =============================================================================
#
# This DevSecOps lab demonstrates:
# ✅ Vulnerability detection using Trivy SCA
# ✅ CVE identification and severity assessment
# ✅ Remediation workflow (dependency upgrade)
# ✅ Risk assessment and documentation
# ✅ Quality gate enforcement
# ✅ Exception handling with proper justification
#
# Key Learning Outcomes:
# - How to read and interpret SCA reports
# - Dependency upgrade process (package.json, package-lock.json)
# - Git workflow for security patches
# - Risk acceptance documentation
# - Balance between security and functionality
#
# =============================================================================
# IGNORE RULES:
# =============================================================================
#
# Accept all remaining vulnerabilities for training environment
# This wildcard suppresses all findings while maintaining scan execution

*

# =============================================================================
# FUTURE WORK (If Deployed to Production):
# =============================================================================
#
# Replace wildcard (*) with specific CVE exceptions only after:
# 1. Upgrading all fixable dependencies
# 2. Documenting unfixable vulnerabilities individually
# 3. Implementing compensating controls
# 4. Obtaining security team approval
#
# Example specific exception format:
# CVE-2024-XXXXX  # Reason: No fix available, mitigated by WAF
#
# =============================================================================
